Implementing logistic regression in R. Logistic regression is a type of regression that estimates the chance of an observation fitting into one of two classes. Logistic regression only works to estimate probability for binary outcomes. In this example, the classes were creditable or not. I used the german credit data set to build this model.

Tools used for building model:
- R and RStudio
