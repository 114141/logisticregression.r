Implementing logistic regression in R to predict credit risk. I used the german credit data set to build this model.


Note: Logistic regression is a classifier used to predict the chance of an observation fitting into one of two classes. In this example, the classes were creditable or not.

Tools used for building model:
- R and RStudio
